About myself

Second year B.Tech student as IIT Bhubaneswar. I enjoyed Open Source contribution in any form because it is awarding way to learn, teach and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.

Without automation of stuff I can't imagine my life so Programming, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence is just like oxygen for me. And more thing guess what ? Cricket .
